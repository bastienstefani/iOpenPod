# Architectural Decision Records

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a durable decision, the context in
which it was made, and its consequences. ADRs explain why the architecture has its
current shape; they do not replace implementation documentation.

## When to write an ADR

Write an ADR when a decision:

- changes a system boundary or dependency direction;
- selects or removes a foundational technology;
- establishes a safety or data-integrity policy;
- constrains multiple future features; or
- reverses an earlier architectural decision.

Do not create an ADR for routine implementation details or easily reversible local
choices.

## Naming and status

Use `NNNN-short-kebab-case-title.md`, with numbers assigned sequentially.

Supported statuses:

- **Proposed** — under active discussion and not yet binding.
- **Accepted** — the current decision.
- **Superseded by ADR-NNNN** — retained for history but no longer current.

Accepted ADRs are immutable historical records. Supersede one with a new ADR instead
of rewriting the old decision.

## Template

```md
# ADR-NNNN: Decision title

- Status: Proposed
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

What forces and constraints require a decision?

## Decision

What was decided?

## Consequences

What becomes easier, harder, required, or prohibited?
```
